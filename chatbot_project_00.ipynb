Agentic AI refers to AI systems designed to autonomously perceive, reason, and act to achieve specific objectives, often through iterative decision-making and learning. Agents can be either software-based or robotic. Our initial focus is on software agents, such as Vertical LLM Agents and the development and deployment of SaaS applications. Eventually, we'll turn our attention to humanoid robots and Physical AI, aiming to bridge the gap between digital intelligence and physical capabilities by creating systems that understand and interact with the world in a human-like manner. Cloud Native technology provides a scalable and reliable platform for running applications, while AI imbues these applications with intelligent, human-like features. A knowledge graph is a structured representation of real-world entities and their relationships, organised as nodes (entities) and edges (relationships) in a graph format. This enables both humans and machines to understand, integrate, and reason about complex, interconnected data from various sources. Our goal is to train you to become an exceptional global developer in Cloud Native, Distributed Computing, Knowledge Graphs, Agentic AI, and Physical AI.\n",

        "What is Physical AI?\n",
        "Physical AI refers to the integration of artificial intelligence with physical entities, such as robots, that can operate and interact in the real world. This concept involves AI systems that not only process data and make decisions but also perform physical actions and understand the laws of physics.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Characteristics:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Real-World Interaction:\n",
        "   - Physical AI systems can perceive their environment through sensors, process this information, and take appropriate actions using actuators.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Embodiment:\n",
        "   - Unlike purely digital AI, Physical AI involves AI embedded in physical bodies, like humanoid robots, which can navigate and manipulate the physical world.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Understanding Physics:\n",
        "   - These AI systems are designed to comprehend and adhere to the physical laws that govern real-world interactions, such as gravity, friction, and object dynamics.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Human-like Functionality:\n",
        "   - Humanoid robots are a prime example of Physical AI, as they are built to perform tasks in environments designed for humans, utilising a form factor that mirrors human anatomy.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Data-Driven Training:\n",
        "   - Physical AI leverages vast amounts of real-world data to train AI models, enabling robots to improve their performance through machine learning and interaction experiences.\n",
        "\n",
        "Applications:\n",
        "- Healthcare:\n",
        "  - Assistive robots that help with patient care, rehabilitation, and surgery.\n",
        "- Service Industry:\n",
        "  - Robots that perform tasks such as cleaning, delivery, and customer service.\n",
        "- Manufacturing:\n",
        "  - Industrial robots that assemble products, manage inventory, and ensure quality control.\n",
        "- Exploration:\n",
        "  - Robots designed for exploration in environments like space, underwater, or disaster zones.\n",
        "\n",
        "Physical AI represents a significant shift from traditional AI applications confined to virtual environments. It aims to bridge the gap between digital intelligence and physical capability, creating systems that can understand and interact with the world in a human-like manner. This evolution has the potential to revolutionise various industries by enhancing automation, improving efficiency, and enabling new forms of human-machine collaboration.\n",
